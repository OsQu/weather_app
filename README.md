# Weather Forecast Application

This is a full-stack weather forecast application split into client and server components.

## Project Structure

### Client (`/client`)
- React-based frontend application
- Displays weather forecast data fetched from the server
- Built with React and uses custom hooks for API communication

### Server (`/server`)
- Backend server application
- Provides weather forecast data through REST API endpoints
- Handles data processing and external weather service integration

## Getting Started

The application is split into two main parts that need to be run separately:

1. Start the server by navigating to `/server` directory
2. Start the client by navigating to `/client` directory

Refer to individual README files in each directory for specific setup and running instructions.
